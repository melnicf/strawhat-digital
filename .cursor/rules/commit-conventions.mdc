# Commit Message Convention

This project enforces [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) via commitlint.

## Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

## Valid Types

- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation changes
- `style` - Code style (formatting, semicolons, etc)
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `perf` - Performance improvements
- `test` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, build, etc)
- `ci` - CI/CD changes
- `build` - Build system or dependency changes
- `revert` - Revert a previous commit

## Examples

```bash
✅ feat: add hero section with animations
✅ fix(navbar): correct mobile menu toggle
✅ docs: update README
✅ style: format with prettier
✅ refactor: simplify navbar structure

❌ Added hero section  # Wrong: capitalized, no type
❌ fix navbar  # Wrong: missing colon
❌ updated docs.  # Wrong: past tense, period at end
```

## Rules

- Use present tense: "add" not "added"
- Don't capitalize first letter
- No period at the end of subject
- Keep subject under 50 characters
- Scope is optional: `feat(scope): message`

**Note:** Commit messages are validated by commitlint on every commit.
