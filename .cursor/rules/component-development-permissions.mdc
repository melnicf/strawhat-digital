# Component Development Permissions

When working on component development tasks, you are allowed to run terminal commands for:

## Package Management
- Installing dependencies (`npm install`, `pnpm add`)
- Adding Astro/React integrations (`astro add react`)
- Running package managers (`pnpm`, `npm`, `yarn`)

## Development Server
- Starting dev servers (`pnpm dev`, `npm run dev`)
- Building projects (`pnpm build`, `npm run build`)
- Running scripts from package.json

## File Operations
- Creating directories (`mkdir`)
- File operations when necessary for component setup

## Astro-Specific Commands
- Adding integrations (`astro add`)
- Generating new components
- Running Astro CLI commands

## Examples of Allowed Commands
```bash
# Package management
pnpm add @astrojs/react
npm install react react-dom

# Development
pnpm dev
npm run build

# Directory creation
mkdir -p src/components/react

# Astro commands
npx astro add react
```

## Component Organization

**Organize components by feature, not by framework:**
- Group related components together (e.g., `src/components/navbar/`, `src/components/hero/`)
- Mix Astro and React components within the same feature folders
- Use descriptive naming: `ClassicNavbar.astro`, `ModernHero.tsx`
- Keep framework-specific logic encapsulated within component files

## Styling Guidelines

**Always use Tailwind CSS for styling:**
- Use Tailwind utility classes instead of custom CSS when possible
- Leverage Tailwind's design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
- Use responsive utilities (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`) for mobile-first design
- Prefer Tailwind's component patterns over custom CSS classes
- Only write custom CSS for complex animations or when Tailwind utilities aren't sufficient

## When to Request Permissions
Only request additional permissions (`network`, `git_write`, `all`) when:
- Installing packages (usually needs `network`)
- Making git commits (needs `git_write`)
- Accessing system-level operations (needs `all`)

For standard component development tasks, no special permissions are needed.
