## The Challenge

INVNT, a global brand experience agency, needed a unified command center to manage complex operations across multiple departments. Teams were juggling dozens of tools—from creative design software to financial systems, HR platforms, and project management tools. The lack of centralization created inefficiencies and made it difficult to maintain context across workflows.

## The Solution

The INVNT Command Center is a sophisticated dashboard that organizes all company tools and applications into intuitive "spaces" while providing real-time analytics, calendar integration, and intelligent workspace management.

The platform features 15+ specialized spaces—Creative, Production, Finance, HR, IT, Innovation, and more—each containing relevant tools and applications. This space-based organization provides logical grouping that matches how teams actually work, with direct access to 50+ tools including Figma, Adobe Creative Cloud, Xero, NetSuite, Slack, and specialized event management software.

Real-time analytics dashboards display event performance metrics, industry breakdowns, seniority analysis, company sentiment scoring, and engagement tracking. A unified calendar view consolidates meetings, tasks, reminders, and events across all teams, eliminating scheduling conflicts.

An AI chat assistant provides context-aware responses for quick answers about tools, processes, and company information. When idle, an immersive Three.js-powered Earth visualization serves as a 3D screensaver, reinforcing the global nature of the agency's work.

The interface supports dark/light themes with custom neon aesthetics matching INVNT's brand, keyboard shortcuts for power users, and presentation-ready fullscreen mode for client meetings.
