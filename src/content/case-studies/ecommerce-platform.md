## The Challenge

Artisan Collective represents over 50 independent artisans, each with unique products and stories. They needed an e-commerce platform that could tell these stories while providing a seamless shopping experience.

## Our Approach

We built a headless commerce solution that gives full creative control over the frontend while leveraging Shopify's robust backend. Each artisan gets a dedicated profile page that showcases their craft and philosophy.

### Key Features

- Artisan profile pages with rich storytelling
- Advanced product filtering and search
- Seamless checkout with multiple payment options
- Real-time inventory management
- Automated email marketing integration

## The Result

Within six months, the platform saw a 200% increase in average order value and a 35% improvement in conversion rate. Artisans reported stronger connections with their customers.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js, TailwindCSS
- **Commerce**: Shopify Headless
- **CMS**: Sanity
- **Payments**: Stripe
- **Email**: Klaviyo
